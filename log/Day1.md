# 100 Days of Code
## Day 1 - Monday, October 2, 2017
I've decided to start my 100 Days of Code challenge by learning Python, Im currently using the following resouces:
* [learnpython.org](https://www.learnpython.org/) - free tutorials
* [Cloud 9](https://c9.io/) - online development environment using containers

Today was a lot of figuring out my new tools: how to use Cloud 9's editor, how to integrate with Git,
and even basic Git commands as I use a GUI in my normal working day. 
I did write a basic Hello World and Float example which Cloud 9 can actually run in a free container it created for me - very cool!

Also, on my way into work this morning I listened to [039 CFML Secrets with Patrick Quinn (AWS, Lucee and SeeFusion)](http://teratech.com/cfml-secrets-with-patrick-quinn-aws-lucee-and-seefusion/) of the [ColdFusion Alive Podcast](http://teratech.com/podcast)
