# 100 Days of Code
## Day 2 - Tuesday, October 3, 2017
Today I worked through the 3 more tutorials learning Python. The dynamic nature of Python is very familiar to me as I've been
working in ColdFusion for 17 years now, but the List notation feels kind of weird to me as they look and feel like arrays. I do
like the ability to repeat them by multiplying a number, but that doesn't seem like something I'd need to do regularly.

Rather than doing my coding on a computer today, since I'm using Cloud 9, I was able to do everything on my Chromebook
while sitting on the couch watching the Simpsons and the news. I like that very much.
