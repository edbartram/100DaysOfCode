# 100 Days of Code
## Day 3 - Thursday, October 5, 2017
I noticed the exercise has a solution button which I clicked and discovered I misunderstood
what I was supposed to accomplish. Turns out I understood Tuples just fine, it was
String formatting that I was trying to get to do more than it can.
I read thru the next tutorial and again the exercise isn't very clear as to what it is
asking the student to do. And again I had to check the tutorial. Somehow I was supposed to
make the leap to go from "Str thera! what some" to "Strings are awesome!". I'm
beginning to think these tutorials aren't as helpful as I was hoping for.
