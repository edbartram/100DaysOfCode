# 100 Days of Code
## Day 0 - Sunday, October 1, 2017
I have given into peer pressure and am accepting a 100 days of code challenge with other developers at my job.
In preparation of the challenge which officially begins tomorrow (hence today being Day 0), I setup my GitHub repository to track the code the code I write each day. 
In addition I plan to maintain a log file describing what I do each day and to record my thoughts on this challenge.
Earlier today I attended a local meetup for "7 Habits of Highly Effective Developers" presented by Corey Miller. 
Below are my notes and for bonus points I used mark down which is almost coding, but more importantly, is new to me and so I am learning something.
